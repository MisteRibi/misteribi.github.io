				The portfolio was created as part of the <a href="https://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/" target="_blank"><i>Vanier College</i></a> program <i>Web and Database Programming</i> I attented.
				<br><br>In the portfolio I talk about my parcours, my passions and my family.
				<br>I wanted to do a portfolio that everyone can view it even in smartphone and big screen.
				<br><br>
				There is the wireframe I did for creating the portfolio.

			<h3>Why did I chose this program at Vanier?</h3>
			<p>
				Since I was fourteen years old I was passionate with computer, technologies, gaming and programming.
				<br><br>After highschool I finaly chose another path: cabinetmaker.
				<br><br>I was loving it but not enough so I finaly stopped it, one of the reason was an accident.
				<br><br>Since then I was wondering if I should go back to school and then a friend of my beautiful girlfriend
				was in the program at Vanier in the evening and recommended it to me.
				<br><br>The evening program was perfect for me since I work all days week.

			<h3>Wireframe</h3>
			<p>
				Before building the website, I did some wireframes for it.
				<br><br>I opted for something simple with softly rounded boxes.
				<br><br>I also wanted multiple view to work with either smaller screen like phone and bigger one like 4k screen.

			<p>
				For the the FHD to 4k screen I added <a href="img/Portfolio_Wireframe_FHD_4k.gif">background pictures</a> on the sides for the <a href="/passions/">passions</a> page.

			<h3>Colors Schemes</h3>
			<p>
				Since the blue color is beautiful, I opted for <span id="hawkes-blue">Hawkes Blue</span> with is complementary color <span id="bisque">Bisque</span>.
				<br><br>For the page title's background I opted for <span id="bright-grey">Bright Grey</span>.
				<br><br>And for the navigation bar's accent color I opted for <span id="navy-blue">Navy Blue</span>.
				<br><br>I do think that all of them together is a good choice of color.
