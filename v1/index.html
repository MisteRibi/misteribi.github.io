				I’m Jérémy Libion, born in France and came in Canada when I was younger with my parents and siblings.
				<br><br>I started working at sixteen years old at a groceries store.
				<br><br>After highschool I did go to school for becoming a cabinetmaker.
				<br><br>I was good in this job however the time limit was difficult to deal with sometime.
				<br><br>Later I stopped working as a cabinetmaker and worked at:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A general store filling the shelves and helping the cashiers.</li>
				<li>A convenience store filling the shelves and as a cashier.</li>
				<li>A hardware store filling and rebuilding the shelves.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Nowadays I'm back to school studiying <i>Web and Database Programming</i> at <a href="https://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/" target="_blank"><i>Vanier College</i></a>.
