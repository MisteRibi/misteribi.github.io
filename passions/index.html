				<h3>Hiking</h3>
				<p>
					As one of my favorite activities, there's hiking, which my girlfriend also love. 
					<br>Therfore, since 2016 we started together visiting every <a href="https://www.sepaq.com/home/index.dot?language_id=1" title="Sepaq park" target="_blank">SEPAQ park</a>.
					<br><br>Since that time we have been hiking every park in the south of Montreal and a few in the north.
					<br>There are more than thirty parks across Quebec state, we have yet to visit them all.
					<br><br>Especially when one park can have multiple distant sectors.
					<br>Like we have yet to hiking the others sectors of <a href="https://www.sepaq.com/pq/mot/index.dot?language_id=1" title="Mont-Tremblant" target="_blank">Mont-Tremblant</a>
					<br><br>We also have climbed the <a href="https://montham.ca/en/" title="Mount Ham" target="_blank">Mount Ham</a> two time.
					<br><br>The first time we have taken the easy path and the second we have taken.
					<br>It was difficult but the view worth it.
					<br><br>Hopefully, one day we will have visited most of them and some park from the Canadian Rockies.
					<br>Beside the Canadian Rockies I would like to hike some of the mountain in Europe.

				<h3>Biking</h3>
				<p>
					My other favorite activity is biking.
					<br>I really, <strong>really</strong> love biking.
					<br>I used to bike every day of the summer. 
					<br><br>I even did two big lap, one between <i>Montreal</i> and <i>Longueil</i> pasing by 
					<i>Sainte-Catherine</i> and <i>Brossard</i>, as you can see on 
					<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1itrlv-BZjyg90lNX6le1USHKInTLGN0&usp=sharing" target="_blank">My Maps from Google</a>.
					<br><br>The other one was just the day before I take the plane to <i>France</i> to see my
					family.
					<br>I started from <i>Lachine</i> toward the end of the <i>West Island</i> going up and right
					toward the <i>Montréal-Trudeau International Airport</i> before rounding it to finish at
					startpoint.
					<br><br>You can see a screenshot of the two circuit I did:

				<p>
					<strong>Fun fact: </strong> I learned how to bike without the littles wheels through the help of my younger sister.
					Since that day, I love to bike.
					<!-- Thanks again Mélanie. -->

				<h3>Gaming</h3>
				<p>
					I started my gaming journey playing mainly the games <i>Lemmings</i> and <i>Trolls</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later on, the next big game for was, and still is, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" target="_blank"><i>Minecraft</i></a>.
					<br><i>Minecraft</i> it's a game about mining cubes and showing creativity.
					<br><br>Even nowadays some schools offer it, especially for childrens with their high creativity.
					<br>I misses the old times when I was playing in a server with my online friends.
					<br>Still have good memory.
					<br><br>Nowadays I'm playing with Vintage Story.
					<br>A game more realist and harder than Minecraft and inspired by eldritch horror themes
