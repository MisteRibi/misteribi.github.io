				<h3>My first dog:</h3>
				<p>
					My oldest dog is named Miley, she was born in August 2009 and she is a Shi-Tzu.
					I could describe this doggo as a calm dog who enjoy walk, treats and naps, because she is always sleeping.
					<br><br>The color of her fur is a mix of brown, gray and mostly white.
					<br><br>Interesting fact even if she's old she loves take walks.
					<br>Once she has been to the park with me and she was so trilled to be outside.
					<br><br><strong>Fun fact:</strong> When she's not trimmed she looks like a mop.

				<h3>My second dog:</h3>
				<p>					
					My younger dog is named Luna, she's a puppy, born on May 2022, and she is a mix-caniche.
					<br><br>I would describe her as a dog who as too much energy, always want to play and bark after everything: dog, kids, squirrels, birds and even at ants.
					<br><br>She as mix colors of whites, gray but mostly black.
					<br><br>Which is funny because her and Miley are completely opposite in color and comportment.
					<br><br>She always wants attention and hug and that really make her lovely even though she loves to eat our shoes.
					<br><br><strong>Fun fact:</strong> She even bark against empty 2 liters empty bottles.
